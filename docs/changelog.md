## Changelog

This document covers possible important changes to KIAUH.

### 2021-01-31

* **This is a big one... KIAUH v3.0 is out.**\
With this update you can now install multiple instances of Klipper, Moonraker, Duet Web Control or Octoprint on the same Pi. This was quite a big rework of the whole script. So bugs can appear but with the help of some testers, i think there shouldn't be any critical ones anymore. In this regards thanks to @lixxbox and @zellneralex for testing.

* Important changes to how installations are set up now: All components get installed as systemd services. Installation via init.d was dropped completely! This shouldn't affect you at all, since the common linux distributions like RaspberryPi OS or custom distributions like MainsailOS, FluiddPi or OctoPi support both ways of installing services. I just wanted to mention it here.

* Now with KIAUH v3.0 and multi-instance installation capabilities, there are some things to point out. You will now need to tell KIAUH where your printers configurations are located when installing Klipper for the first time. Even though it is not recommended, you can change this location with the help of KIAUH and rewrite Klipper and Moonraker to use the new location.

* When setting up a multi-instance system, the folder structure will only change slightly. The goal was to keep it as compatible as possible with the custom distributions like mainsailOS and FluiddPi. This should help converting a single-instance setup of mainsailOS/FluiddPi to a multi-instance setup in no time, but keeping single-instance backwards compatibility if needed at a later point in time.

* The folder structure is as follows when setting up multi-instances:\
Each printer instance will get its own folder within your configuration location. The decision to this specific structure was made to make it as painless and easy as possible to convert to a multi-instance setup.
Here is an example:
    ```shell
    /home/<username>
              â””â”€â”€ klipper_config
                  â”œâ”€â”€ printer_1
                  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ printer.cfg
                  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ moonraker.conf
                  â”œâ”€â”€ printer_2
                  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ printer.cfg
                  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ moonraker.conf
                  â””â”€â”€ printer_n
                      â”œâ”€â”€ printer.cfg
                      â””â”€â”€ moonraker.conf
    ```
* Also when setting up multi-instances of each service, the name of each service slightly changes.
Each service gets its corresponding instance added to the service filename.

    **This only applies to multi-instances! Single instance installations with KIAUH will keep their original names!**

    Corresponding to the filetree example from above that would mean:
    ```
    Klipper services:
            --> klipper-1.service
            --> klipper-2.service
            --> klipper-n.service

    Moonraker services:
            --> moonraker-1.service
            --> moonraker-2.service
            --> moonraker-n.service
    ```
* The same service file rules from above apply to DWC and OctoPrint even though only Klipper and Moonraker are shown in this example.

* You can start, stop and restart all Klipper, Moonraker, DWC and OctoPrint instances from the KIAUH main menu. For doing this, just type "stop klipper", "start moonraker", "restart octoprint" and so on.

* KIAUH v3.0 relocated its ini-file. It is now a hidden file in the users home-directory calles `.kiauh.ini`. This has the benefit of keeping all values in that file between possible re-installations of KIAUH. Otherwise that file would be lost.

* The option of adding more trusted clients to the moonraker.conf file was dropped. Since you can edit this file right inside of Mainsail or Fluidd, only some basic entries are made which get you running.

* I bet i have missed mentioning other stuff as well because it took me quite some time to re-write many functions. So i just hope you like the new version ðŸ˜„

### 2020-11-28

* KIAUH now supports the installation, update and removal of [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen). This feature was was provided by [jordanruthe](https://github.com/jordanruthe)! Thank you!

### 2020-11-18

* Some changes to Fluidd caused a little rework on how KIAUH will install/update Fluidd from now on. Please see the [fluidd v1.0.0-rc0 release notes](https://github.com/cadriel/fluidd/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0) for further information about what modifications to the moonraker.conf file exactly had to be done. In a nutshell, KIAUH will now always patch the required entries to the moonraker.conf if not already there.

### 2020-10-30:

* The user can now choose to install Klipper as a systemd service.

* The Shell Command extension and `shell_command.py` got renamed to G-Code Shell Command extension and `gcode_shell_command.py`. In case the [pending PR](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/pull/2173) will be merged in the future, this was an early attempt to dodge possible incompatibilities. The [G-Code Shell Command docs](gcode_shell_command.md) has been updated accordingly.

* The way how KIAUH interacts and writes to the users printer.cfg got changed. Usually KIAUH wrote everything directly into the printer.cfg. The way it will work from now on is, that a new file called `kiauh.cfg` will be created if there is something that needs to be written to the printer.cfg and everything gets written to `kiauh.cfg` instead. The only thing which then gets written to the users printer.cfg is `[include kiauh.cfg]`. This line will be located at the very top of the existing printer.cfg with a little comment as a note. The user can then decide to either keep the `kiauh.cfg` or take its content, places it into the printer.cfg directly and remove the `[include kiauh.cfg]`.

* The `mainsail_macros.cfg` got renamed to `webui_macros.cfg`. Since Mainsail and Fluidd both use the same kind of pause, cancel and resume macros, a more generic name was chosen for the file containing the example macros one can choose to install when installing those webinterfaces.

### 2020-10-10:

* Support for changing the Klipper branch to the moonraker-dev branch from @Arksine has been dropped. Support for Moonraker has been merged into Klipper mainline a long time ago.

* A new function is available from the main menu. You can now upload your log files to http://paste.c-net.org/ to share them for debugging purposes.

### 2020-10-06:

* Fluidd, a new Klipper interface got added to the list of available installers. At the same time some installation routines have changed or have seen some rework. Changes were made to the installation of NGINX configurations. A method was introduced to change the listen port of a webinterface configuration if there is already another webinterface listening on the default port (80).

* At the moment, the Moonraker installer no longer asks you whether you want to install a web interface too. For now you therefore have to install them with their respective installers. Please report any bugs or issues you encounter.

### 2020-09-17:

* The dev-2.0 branch will be abandoned as of today. If you did a checkout to that branch in the past, you have to checkout back to master to receive updates.

### 2020-09-12:

* The old [dwc2-for-klipper](https://github.com/Stephan3/dwc2-for-klipper) won't be supported anymore!\
The is a new, fully rewritten project available: [dwc2-for-klipper-socket](https://github.com/Stephan3/dwc2-for-klipper-socket).\
The installer of this script also got rewritten to make use of that new project. You will not be able to install or remove the old [dwc2-for-klipper](https://github.com/Stephan3/dwc2-for-klipper) with KIAUH anymore if you updated KIAUH to the newest version.
